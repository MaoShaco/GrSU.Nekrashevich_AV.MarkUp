						Wakfu is a tactical turn-based MMORPG developed by Ankama Games, which was released for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux
					</p>

In the time of Dofus, an ogre named Ogrest managed to get all six Dofus eggs for the sake of someone he loved. However, she was interested only in the eggs, and Ogrest killed her in a fit of rage. Later realizing what he'd done, he climbed atop Mount Zinit and cried for 1,000 years. This brings us to the time of WAKFU. Now the "goal" is to defeat Ogrest, but, like in Dofus, this is not necessary
Wakfu features a turn-based combat system similar to Dofus and Dofus Arena, it also contains elements inspired by tactical RPG.
Players walk around with the screen scrolling while they move, as opposed to Dofus where the camera is static and characters move to a new area by walking to the edge of the current screen.
Some parts of the game are player-managed: Governmental affairs such as organizing militias or elections for positions like governor are performed by players themselves.
Another similar addition is environmental management by players. Players can maintain resource levels by planting seeds as they harvest crops and hunt wildlife or simply take what they want, decreasing availability for other players.
There are 16 classes, each one featuring 25 abilities. Each class has three types of elemental spells (out of four possible elements) with 5 spells per type, one category of 5 special actions specific to the class, and one category of 5 abilities that passively improve the character's other capabilities. Contrary to typical RPGs which present characters with new, more powerful abilities throughout the course of the game, Wakfu grants characters all their spells by the early stages and thereafter allows players to strengthen them.
