						Dofus Arena incarnates the essence of DOFUS's gameplay, featuring increasingly difficult tactical fights. As a coach, each player creates and manages his own unique team of characters, enabling him to face opponents of all kinds, in different elements.
					</p>
					<p>
Currently two forms of combat are available, 1vs1 and 2vs2. In these modes, your team(s) and your opponents team(s) battle against each other in one of the 18 maps.

The only goal of the game is to lower the health of all the individuals in the opponents team to 0. Or in other words: the goal is to make your damage spells hit while evading, recovering and redistributing the damage spells of your opponent.

The game promotes planning and using different spells in succession (often called a combo).

The turn order is determined by the initiative of each fighter. This stat depends on the class and can be altered with equipment. The order goes from the fighter with the highest amount of initiative to the one with the least initiative.

The game futures a side/back system: you get 20% more damage attacking the side and 40% more for attacking the back of your opponent.

To reduce repetition, there are 2 elements randomly chosen at the start of the game: bonus cards and event cards. Bonus cards are strong actions that can be activated by everybody, but can only be used once per team. Event cards are cards that have an impact on the game and change every round, this ranges from "everybody deals 10% more wind damage" or "all sacriers (a class) gain 2 MP and do 10% more damage" to "everybody loses 1 AP".
