						In general there are 5 games which Ankama have done, on this page you can found some general information about every games.
					</p>
					<p>

						So first of all the main and the most  popular game which was produced with this company its Dofus.
						Tha main idea of the game its a graphic with the hundreds of colourful pictures and objects inside;
						The second idea its a tactic of the game, the main feature that its a MMORPG game with close battle system, in which u 
						shouldn't to click as much as ur keyboard can allow u.
						The third feature of this game its very intreteresting story with deep roots and which is showed at the special animated series Dofus.

						Cuz of the success of the tactic from first game they developed their second game which was based only on fights with easy other in such
						 tendention and this game was called Dofus Arena.
						 
						 The third and the most popular game which have hundreds of hierarchy from Dofus is Wakfu, the main different feature from Dofus its Open World
						 for hundreds beta-testers of this game it was realy new and interesting;
						 
						 Throw some years this both this games was become multiplatformed and developers started to work under the new project which was called Wakfu Islands
						 This Game Reach the mount of Everest when everyone on XBox and using Sony PlayStation could play with each other with the main game features and still this
						 game get updates optionally every weekend. Still in some years Wakfu never loose the rounds among other tactic online games.
						 
						 So and the last game which is now in close alpha testing is Fly'N this game cross all main features from all the previous games and get open battle system
						 with the tactic style based world.
